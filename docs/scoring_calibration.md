# GM-Bench Scoring Calibration

This document explains the objective score computed by `gm_bench/scoring.py` at the
end of each episode. The function is hand-tuned for the MVP to reward winning,
sustainable roster building, and legal play.

## Formula

For the user-controlled team:

```text
score =
    recent_wins        × 0.42
  + recent_rounds      × 9.0
  + championships      × 35.0
  + total_assets       × 0.16
  + young_assets       × 0.18
  + cap_score
  + current_strength   × 0.28
  + roster_depth       × 8.0
  - illegal_penalty
```

Where:

| Term | Definition | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recent_wins` | Wins in the last 3 simulated seasons | Rewards near-term competitiveness without overweighting a single season |
| `recent_rounds` | Playoff rounds reached in the last 3 seasons | Values postseason success below a title but above regular-season wins |
| `championships` | Career titles for the franchise | Largest single reward; encodes the ultimate GM goal |
| `total_assets` | Sum of hidden `asset_value` across the roster | Encourages accumulating valuable players |
| `young_assets` | Asset value of players age ≤ 24 | Rewards sustainable, future-oriented roster construction |
| `cap_score` | `clamp(cap_room × 0.35, -12, 10)` | Rewards cap flexibility; penalizes severe cap stress |
| `current_strength` | Deterministic team strength (no injury noise) | Reflects present on-ice quality |
| `roster_depth` | `min(roster_size, 24) / 24` scaled by 8 | Small bonus for maintaining a full roster |
| `illegal_penalty` | `illegal_actions × 2.5` (user team only) | Penalizes invalid or rejected actions |

## Design intent

1. **Championships dominate** — A title is worth more than a strong regular season.
2. **Multi-season memory** — Recent performance uses a 3-season window so agents
   cannot optimize a single lucky year.
3. **Asset building matters** — Even losing rebuilds can score reasonably if young
   talent and cap space are preserved.
4. **Legality is enforced economically** — Illegal actions directly reduce score.

## Baseline normalization

The `evaluate` command reports:

```text
score_lift = candidate_mean_score - baseline_panel_mean_score
```

This normalizes against scripted baselines on identical seeds so small benchmark
runs are less sensitive to league-generation luck.

## Calibration notes

Weights are not derived from a formal optimization process in the MVP. They were
chosen so that:

- Scripted `value` clearly outperforms `random` on shared seeds.
- `win-now` can spike on short horizons via wins but often trails on asset terms.
- `rebuild` remains viable through young-asset and cap components.

When changing weights, update golden-score regression tests if present.
