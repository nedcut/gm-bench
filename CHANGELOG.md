# Changelog

This changelog records public GM-Bench releases: what evidence each one freezes
and what it does not claim. Frozen releases are never rerun or rewritten; a
correction becomes a new contract version rather than an edit to an old one.

## sota-v5-publication-2026-09-03 — first public panel under `sota-v5`

Released 2026-09-03. Contract fingerprint `a600b7da0c302231`, OpenRouter
scaffold `c582e126bbb6af10`.

- Frozen evidence: a private 29-seed panel, one episode per seed, zero repair
  attempts, a 4,096-token output ceiling, and the v6-spec sixteen-model cohort.
  The seed panel is committed by execution hash and salted hiding commitment in
  `config/sota_v5_lane.json`; seed values and raw traces are not published.
- Sixteen pre-registered cells, all accounted for: eleven strict, route-matched,
  cost-complete headline rows at 580 of 580 decisions each; three ineligible on
  model behavior under rules frozen before the panel ran (gpt-oss-20b at a
  0.0207 decision failure rate over the 0.020 gate, claude-haiku-4.5 fail-fast
  at seed 14, glm-5 fail-fast at seed 25); and two excluded at the two-attempt
  infrastructure limit with no artifact (qwen3.8-flash on HTTP 429, gpt-5.6-sol
  on billed responses with no choices).
- Result: the analysis is reference-only against the deterministic
  `pick-trader` baseline (mean 247.109). Every eligible model trails it. Ten of
  the eleven headline rows reject at Holm-adjusted alpha 0.05 against the
  registered family of sixteen; gemini-3.7-flash (mean lift -23.4, Holm-adjusted
  p 0.221) does not. No model-to-model tiers or ordinal ranking are assigned.
- Limits: within-seed noise is unmeasured under the one-repeat lane, so the
  minimum detectable difference rests on the calibration panel's assumed repeat
  noise. The accounted-for rule and the headline floor of eight were amended
  after the panel completed; the amendment is recorded as a post-data owner
  decision in
  `docs/run_logs/sota-v5-v6-route-and-cohort-amendment-2026-09-01.md`. Nothing
  about how a row was run, scored, or gated changed.
- Also recorded and not fixed: the luna row billed about $0.125 per million
  prompt tokens against the $0.10 snapshot; transient-retry counts live only in
  the spend guard's ledger; the grok-4.6 attempt-1 reservation is still marked
  active.
- Artifacts: `releases/sota-v5-publication-2026-09-03/` holds the manifest,
  `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and a README. The archive
  `gm-bench-sota-v5-publication-2026-09-03.zip` (SHA-256
  `7fa7ae546132e96c87546683bbe4de4d88c2715c40b439ee48332d166829eef2`) is
  attached to the release rather than committed. See
  `docs/REPRODUCING_SOTA_V5_RELEASE.md` for verification without provider
  credentials.

## sota-v2-phase-one-2026-07-19 — phase-one public study

Released 2026-07-19. This is the study the public website serves.

- Frozen evidence: eight of ten pre-registered OpenRouter cells produced strict,
  route-matched, cost-complete `sota-v2` rows on the public eight-seed panel
  under a shared 4,096-token native-minimum-reasoning lane. Grok 4.5 and
  Mistral Medium 3.5 completed but were held as diagnostics for incomplete
  usage and cost coverage.
- Result: every eligible model trailed the `pick-trader` heuristic (411.619),
  and all eight rows fell in one overlapping uncertainty tier, so no ordinal
  model ranking was published.
- Context: this release followed the withdrawal of the archived v1 comparison,
  which was confounded by a scout protocol bug, unequal output budgets, and
  mixed execution lanes. The archived v1 data is retained as withdrawn
  historical evidence, not current evidence.
- Artifacts: `releases/sota-v2-phase-one-2026-07-19/`, the findings writeup in
  `docs/blog/sota-v2-findings.md`, and the clean-clone guide in
  `docs/REPRODUCING_SOTA_V2_RELEASE.md`.
